# Containerized Web App with Terraform

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to set up a containerized web application using Terraform for Infrastructure as Code (IaC). The project provisions necessary cloud resources, deploys a web application in a container, and ensures scalability and reliability.

## Architecture
The architecture of this project includes:
- A cloud provider (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP)
- A container registry to store Docker images
- A container orchestration service (e.g., Kubernetes, ECS)
- Networking components (e.g., VPC, subnets, security groups)
- Load balancers for traffic distribution
- Auto-scaling groups for scalability

## Setup Instructions
Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. **Clone the Repository**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Containerized-Web-App-Terraform.git
    cd Containerized-Web-App-Terraform
    ```

2. **Install Terraform**
    Download and install Terraform from the [official website](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html).

3. **Configure Cloud Provider Credentials**
    Ensure your cloud provider credentials are configured. For example, for AWS:
    ```sh
    aws configure
    ```

4. **Initialize Terraform**
    Initialize the Terraform configuration:
    ```sh
    terraform init
    ```

5. **Plan and Apply Terraform Scripts**
    Review the plan and apply the configuration:
    ```sh
    terraform plan
    terraform apply
    ```

## Terraform Scripts
The project includes the following Terraform scripts:

- **main.tf**: Defines the primary infrastructure components.
- **variables.tf**: Contains variable definitions for the project.
- **outputs.tf**: Specifies the outputs of the Terraform configuration.
- **provider.tf**: Configures the cloud provider.

### Example: main.tf
```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = var.region
}

resource "aws_vpc" "main" {
  cidr_block = var.vpc_cidr
}

resource "aws_subnet" "subnet" {
  vpc_id     = aws_vpc.main.id
  cidr_block = var.subnet_cidr
}

resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami           = var.ami_id
  instance_type = var.instance_type
  subnet_id     = aws_subnet.subnet.id
}
```

## Resources Provisioned
The Terraform scripts provision the following resources:
- VPC and subnets
- Security groups
- EC2 instances or container services
- Load balancers
- Auto-scaling groups
- IAM roles and policies

## Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive guide to setting up a containerized web application using Terraform. By following the setup instructions and utilizing the provided Terraform scripts, you can easily provision and manage the necessary cloud resources for your application.
